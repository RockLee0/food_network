               <h2>Chocolate Dump Cake</h2>
               <p>OK, so the name is a bit unfortunate. But the concept is everything—just throw the ingredients into a bowl, pour into a pan, and voilà—you have chocolate cake. Fun fact: A little bit of espresso in the batter makes it taste extra chocolatey. </p>

               <h2>Peach Cobbler</h2>
               <p>Once you’ve mastered drop biscuits (the easiest kind), peach cobbler is the logical next step. Just don’t skimp on the vanilla ice cream!  </p>

               <h2>Coconut Cookies</h2>
               <p>These quick treats are kind of a sugar cookie-macaroon mash-up, and we are here for it. Plus, they use only one bowl, which means less dishes for you. </p>
